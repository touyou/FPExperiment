synopsis: Low-level networking interface
description:
    This package provides a low-level networking interface.
    .
    In network-2.6 the @Network.URI@ module was split off into its own
    package, network-uri-2.6. If you're using the @Network.URI@ module
    you can automatically get it from the right package by adding this
    to your .cabal file:
    .
    > flag network-uri
    >   description: Get Network.URI from the network-uri package
    >   default: True
    >
    > library
    >   -- ...
    >   if flag(network-uri)
    >     build-depends: network-uri >= 2.6, network >= 2.6
    >   else
    >     build-depends: network-uri < 2.6, network < 2.6
    .
    That is, get the module from either network < 2.6 or from
    network-uri >= 2.6.
